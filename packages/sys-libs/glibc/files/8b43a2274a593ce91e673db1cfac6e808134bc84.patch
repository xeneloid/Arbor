Subject: [PATCH] Fix race in free() of fastbin chunk: BZ #15073

Perform sanity check only if we have_lock.  Due to lockless nature of fastbins
we need to be careful derefencing pointers to fastbin entries (chunksize(old)
in this case) in multithreaded environments.

The fix is to add have_lock to the if-condition checks.  The rest of the patch
only makes code more readable.

	* malloc/malloc.c (_int_free): Perform sanity check only if we
	have_lock.
