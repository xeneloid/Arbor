SUMMARY="Perl Compatible Regular Expression library"
DESCRIPTION="
The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has its
own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the
POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE library is free, even for building
commercial software.

PCRE was originally written for the Exim MTA, but is now used by many
high-profile open source projects, including Apache, PHP, KDE, Postfix, Analog,
and Nmap. PCRE has also found its way into some well known commercial products,
like Apple Safari. Some other interesting projects using PCRE include Chicken,
Ferite, Onyx, Hypermail, Leafnode, Askemos, and Wenlin.
