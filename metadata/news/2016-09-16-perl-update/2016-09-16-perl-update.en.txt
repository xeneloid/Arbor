Perl has been bumped to version 5.24.

Perl 5.22 was masked with a CVE, so the steps are shorter to allow for
avoiding cave's complaints about it.

Simply install dev-lang/perl:5.24, while uninstalling perl:5.22 and
rebuilding packages depending on perl:5.22:

    # cave resolve -1x perl:5.24 \!perl:5.22 -D perl:5.22

If you have any cross targets with Perl modules installed, you'll need to
repeat this for them, using `--make cross-compile` and the triplet of the
cross target for ${CHOST}.

Additionally, if you installed anything manually (via `cpan`, for example)
you will have to reinstall those as well so that they use the new version.
