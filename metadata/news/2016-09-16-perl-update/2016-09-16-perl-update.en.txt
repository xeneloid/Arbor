Perl has been bumped to version 5.24.

So, here's the upgrade procedure, same as it has always been... well, except
that perl:5.22 is masked due to a CVE.

1. Install dev-lang/perl:5.24.

    # cave resolve -1x perl:5.24 -W perl:5.22

2. Set 5.24 as the Perl provider.

    # eclectic perl set 5.24

3. Rebuild everything that installs a Perl module, replacing CHOST with the
   triplet matching your host.

    # cave resolve -1x -W perl:5.22 $(cave print-owners -f '%c/%p:%s ' /usr/${CHOST}/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.22-arch)
    # cave resolve -1x -W perl:5.22 $(cave print-owners -f '%c/%p:%s ' /usr/${CHOST}/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.22-pure)

If you have any cross targets with Perl modules installed, you'll need to
repeat step 3 for them, using `--make cross-compile` and the triplet of the
cross target for ${CHOST}.

Additionally, if you installed anything manually (via `cpan`, for example),
you will have to reinstall those as well so that they use the new version.
